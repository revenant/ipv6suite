INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The INET framework can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 3.0 or later.
It must be compiled with dynamic NED loading enabled (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes 
setting).

LINUX (UNIX)

1. Make sure you OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (try "which nedtool").

2. Change to the INET framework directory and edit the inetconfig file
   to make sure it contains the right settings. You'll probably
   need to adjust ROOT.

3. Re-generate the omnetppconfig file to get the local OMNeT++ configuration
   by typing "opp_makemake -f --genconfig omnetppconfig"

4. Type "make" to build everything. That should be it.

5. If there's a Makefile-related error, or if you change add/remove files,
   try recreating the makefiles by typing "./makemake".
   If you add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify "makemake".

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change into Examples/ and type
"./rundemo".

The INET framework is still work in progress, and thus, not everything will work.
Notably, MPLS is being revised, and RTP hasn't been integrated yet.



WINDOWS

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW, see instructions for Unix.

If you're using Microsoft Visual C++ (6.0 or .NET):

1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation. Note that 3.0 alpha versions
   are only distributed in source code form, so you'll have to compile
   it yourself. Make sure the sample simulations work OK. Also, OMNeT++
   and MSVC should be in the PATH (you can verify this by typing "nedtool"
   and "nmake" at the cmd prompt.)

2. Change to the INET framework directory. Edit the inetconfig.vc file and
   adjust the OMNETPP_ROOT setting to suit your installation.

3. Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" to build everything.
      HINT: Create an "m.bat" file with the content "nmake -f Makefile.vc %*".
      It will save you a lot of typing!

4. If there's a Makefile-related error, or if you change add/remove files,
   try recreating the makefiles by typing "makemake", then
   "nmake -f makefile.vc depend".
   If you add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify "makemake.cmd".

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change to Examples/ and type
"rundemo.bat".

The INET framework is still work in progress, and thus, not everything will work.
Notably, MPLS is being revised, and RTP hasn't been integrated yet.

Have fun.
