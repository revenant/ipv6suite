MIPv6Network.ini

[Run 1]

does not route properly even though using auto routing (prob. same run as
omnetpp.ini -r 1 except power is greater?)

[Run 2]
does not work

Runs 3-6 are all tests
to omit 0 values from scalar file
grep -v "[ ][[:space:]]\<0" omnetpp.sca

[Run 4]

Same as 3 except move between HA and router2 (ping pong)
Segfaults when given a false address to ping

PCOAForwarding.ini -r 3

Runs but there is a big handover at the start perhaps ping packets didn't get
through then?
