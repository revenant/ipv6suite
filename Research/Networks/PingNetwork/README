The initial ping starts at 30 and goes from client1 to server4.

The Routers do not advertise.  The defaults are added to the hosts and the
  routers so that the path is pretty much predetermined.

Differences attributed to the format specifiers for display.

The strangest thing is on gcc3.1 the simulation stops at 200 as no messages left
to process whilst the gcc2.96 version continues running the tcp module in
client3.

The one that started at time 80 (multicast ping) will only be able to send 3
pings after that it doesn't send anymore.  Don't know why.  But it has always done
this.
