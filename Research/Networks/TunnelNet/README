TunnelNet Run 1 is testing source routing and tunneling of link local
addresses across the Internet. (sort of like a VPN without the security from encryption)

Client 1 has to ping server on a private address fe80:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:4 as
shown in omnetpp.ini.
Router A has a trigger set up for the above mentioned address to tunnel the
packet (from xml file)

 <tunnelEntry exitIface="ppp1" entryPoint="fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:ab"
	exitPoint="fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:cd">
	<triggers destination="fe80:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:4"/>	
      </tunnelEntry>

Now Router A also has some source routes set up to prescribe path that the
tunnelled packet travels. This is shown by the sourceRouteEntry with the
finalDestination of "fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:cd"" which matches with the exit point
of the tunnel.

   <sourceRouteEntry finalDestination="fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:cd">
	<nextHop address="fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:ba"/>
	<nextHop address="fec0:0:0:0:260:97ff:0:db"/>
      </sourceRouteEntry>

The next two hops to reach Router C are router B and D. On Router D the reverse path
is set up using the same mechanism so that the flow of packets follows a figure of 8
pattern through the four routers.

Using ODAD option will make all nodes do an unsolicited NA
and so ND does not occur and we will get a constant ping round trip time.
