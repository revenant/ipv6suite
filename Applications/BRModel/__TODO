DOCUMENTATION IS MISSING DETAILS
- general description is missing (what is active and idle period, etc)
- what does it send?
- interface to lower layers? what should it be connected to? 
  what controlInfo does it attach?

VBR SCOPE IS CONFUSED
- VBRSrcModel: param "pixPerFrame": if this is a streaming video model,
  then it should be explained and probably more parameters added.
  if it's NOT video, then is SHOULDN'T have a parameter called "pixPerFrame"!
