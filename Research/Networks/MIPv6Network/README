Normal MIPv6 on and no HMIP 
links we seem to have first handover starting at 47
then another one at 130. However the one at 130 is stuffed because it is a
missed rtradv triggered not his L2 triggers. They do not appear to be the cause
of the handover.

At Router3 the ping reply from Server4 cannot be sent back to the coa of MN due
to addrResln failing for addr fe80:0:0:480a:deff:fed4:5948:0. Now eventually it
registers this failure after many ping reply have been waiting at AddrResln.
When it does realise this failure it suddenly sends 1 ICMP unreachable per
packet and you end up with around 40 all coming very quickly at the ICMPv6Core.
This is where I get the mesage about dropping them.  Funnily enough the rest of
the ping replies make it back after this bad batch as they use the default
router instead of trying to look for that bad addr on one of the links connected
to router3.  Guess default router is HA so packet actually goes via triangular
route to MN.  Shows how robust the routing mechanism is in IPv6 and MIPv6 too.


Eric's L2 trigger
Assertion triggers because coa not assigned yet.  This is due to fact that DAD
is not completed yet since this handover step is happening at exact same time as
just after initiating DAD. Requires either assign address first and do DAD
simultaneously or

Runs but there is a big handover at the start perhaps ping packets didn't get
through then?
