Multicast Routing Example

This network consists of four router and six hosts. It shows routing behavior
with preconfigured static routes for unicast and multicast datagrams. 
Multicast datagrams are duplicated by the router only if there is a group 
member in the subnet. Therefore, there is no generation of redundant or 
unnecessary data packets.

The hosts run a simple application which sends UDP packets to randomly
chosen hosts or multicast groups.

Connections between router and hosts are configured as 10Mb ethernet,
connections between the router are fast fibre optic cables. Host 2 is
connected to host 3 with a serial modem connection which is used only
for direct communication between them both - all other packets are
directly forwarded to router 1.
