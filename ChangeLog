03/2004 through 10/2004  Andras Varga

        * practically, complete rewrite. See change log at 
        http://ctieware.eng.monash.edu.au/twiki/bin/view/Simulation/IPSuiteLogOfChanges

2004-02-04  Andras Varga

        * got it compiled with omnetpp-3.0pre1. changes:
        - added #include <iostream>, using std::ostream at a couple of places
        - deprecated receiveOn(), receiveNewOn() no longer exists, replaced by:
                msg = receive();
                ASSERT(dfmsg->arrivedOn("fromEnqHook"));  // FIXME revise this
        * removed ProcessorManager altogether

2003-09-19  Andras Varga

        * added the MPLS/LDP/RSVP-TE models created by Xuan Thang Nguyen
        (Xuan.T.Nguyen@uts.edu.au) at UTS (University of Technology, Sydney). 
        See http://charlie.it.uts.edu.au/~tkaphan/xtn/capstone/

        * did IPsuite modifications necessary fo MPLS. Modularity is preserved:
        it is still possible to build IPSuite without the MPLS models.

2003-09-18  Andras Varga

        * merged patches for compiling with MSVC.

        * module descriptions (comments) added to/rearranged in all NED files 
        for documentation generation with new opp_neddoc.

        * DIRECTORY STRUCTURE WAS REARRANGED along the lines of the OSI layers,
        and also to make it consistent with the IPv6Suite. Hopefully every file
        is now where one would expect to find it.

        * added makemake.cmd for generating Makefile.vc's (using opp_nmakemake)
        for building with MSVC, and makemake for generating Unix makefiles

        * lots of minor fixes to make the code compile with MSVC. 
        Note: for compatibility with MSVC6.0,
          1. return type of dup() should ALWAYS be cObject* (and cannot be the
             actual class name)
          2. class variables cannot be initialized (even const or
             static const ones) within the class declaration.

        * updated for recent OMNeT++ versions: added ",row" to vector module
        display strings; removed className() methods, etc.

        * FIXME: KIDSRouter was missing from the original IPSuite! KIDSNw1 
        didn't compile. I temporarily substituted a copy of NextHopRouter.

        * taken ipsuite-20021124-src.tgz and started improving it.

2001-12-10  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Global changes for OMNeT++ 2.2 conformance:
        copy constructor -> const argument
        virtual long length(const ) -> virtual long length(const) const
        virtual int numInitStages() -> virtual int numInitStages () const
        virtual char *className() -> virtual const char* className() const
        virtual cObject *dup() -> virtual cObject *dup() const
        cObject& operator=(cObject& o) -> cObject& operator=(const cObject& o)
        
2001-08-31  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * CVS-Tag da-kussaether: Work on TCP by Rolf Kussaether;
        implementation of TCP flavours Reno (fast recovery) and New Reno.

2001-03-19 Verena Kahmann <kahmann@telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de>
        * deleted all queues and behaviors except FIFO* and the basic behaviors.
        Maybe we have to apply some extra cleaning still.
2000-12-19  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * recent (standalone) TCP model is merged into the ip-suite. The
        simple test network is now located in ./Networks/TCPTester

2000-12-13  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * makeipsuite: replaced by top level Makefile

        * rundemo: front end for launching all available simulations

        * Makefile: Top level makefile to create Makefiles from Makefile.in
        in all subdirectories

        * removed mmake in subdirectories and replaced them by Makefile.in
