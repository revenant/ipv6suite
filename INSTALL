INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The IPv6SuiteWithINET can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 3.1 or later.
It must be compiled with dynamic NED loading enabled (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes 
setting).

LINUX (UNIX)

1. Make sure you OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (try "which nedtool").

2. Change to the IPv6SuiteWithINET directory and edit the inetconfig file 
   to make sure it contains the right settings. You'll probably
   need to adjust ROOT.

3. Re-generate the omnetppconfig file to get the local OMNeT++ configuration
   by typing "opp_makemake -f --genconfig omnetppconfig"

4. Type "./makemake" to create the makefiles.

5. Type "make" to build everything. That should be it.

6. If you add/remove files later, recreate the makefiles with "./makemake".
   If you add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify "makemakefiles".

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change into Examples/ and type
"./rundemo".


WINDOWS

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW, see instructions for Unix. The instructions
below are for Visual C++ 7.1.

IMPORTANT: YOU NEED VC 7.1 .NET! IPv6SuiteWithINET won't compile with VC 6.0.

1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation. Make sure the sample simulations 
   work OK. Also, OMNeT++ and MSVC should be in the PATH (you can verify this 
   by typing "nedtool" and "nmake" at the cmd prompt.)

2. Change to the INET framework directory. Edit the inetconfig.vc file and
   adjust the OMNETPP_ROOT setting to suit your installation.

3. Run "makemake.bat" to create the makefiles.

4. Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" to build everything.
      HINT: Create an "m.bat" file with the content "nmake -f Makefile.vc %*".
      It will save you a lot of typing!

5. If you add/remove files, recreate the makefiles by typing "makemake", then
   "nmake -f makefile.vc depend".
   If you add/remove/rename directories, you'll need to modify "makemakefiles".

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change to Examples/ and type
"rundemo.bat".
