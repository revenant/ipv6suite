- move ARP up into IP layer; unify L2 interfaces

- apps: add startTime param; IPAddressResolver should only be invoked at startTime not in initialize()!

- TCP tests fail now (TCPDump has changed)

- create RED etc for routers

- in TCP: just before fast retransmit, it appears that sendData() sends an already 
  transmitted segment again! this should not happen, it should send from snd_max!

- if a node pings itself, that'll be "destination unreachable" -- fix it
