- move ARP up into IP layer; unify L2 interfaces

- apps: add startTime param; IPAddressResolver should only be invoked at startTime not in initialize()!

- TCP tests fail now (TCPDump has changed)

- create RED etc for routers

- if a node pings itself, that'll be "destination unreachable" -- fix it
