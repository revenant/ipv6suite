This network is suppose to fail when doing ping because it's trying to ping its
other interface.  Now because of the way conceptual sending works.  It
doesn't return a self reference to local host it find default router.
This situation occured because we arranged the ethnetwork and ppp links
so that what was a psuedorandom address assigned to server4, a routable
path is now unfortunately not routing according to implementation of
conceptual sending. 

This brough up some assertion failures and seg faults in the addr res code.  So
just leave as is.

After adding a new RoutingTableTest node the network encounters a runtime error
as RoutingTableTest node tries to send its NUD stuff via output[1] gate of ND
module which does not exist as there is only one interface on this node.  It
does this because I've added extra interfaces into routing table during test.
Will have to find some way of stopping a node from starting up and perhaps even
removing interfaces from interface array so this does not happen in future.

When built as CMDENV environment is when more XML testing occurs.  Perhaps I should only let it do the RoutingTableTest then.
