IPv6SuiteWithINET
=================

IPv6SuiteWithINET comes from the effort to unify IPv6Suite and the INET
Framework. Eventually, all components not directly related to IPv4 and
IPv6 will be shared between the two model frameworks.

Unlike IPv6Suite releases so far, IPv6SuiteWithINET doesn't require special
version of OMNeT++ (works with stock 3.1), or any external libraries or tools.
It compiles on Windows as well (VC 7.1 .NET required.)

--------------------------
- All application layer modules, TCP and UDP now handle both IPv4 and IPv6.
  Above L3, all components use the IPvXAddress class to represent addresses,
  which can contain an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

- FlatNetworkConfigurator6 added. This mostly eliminates the need for
  specifying routes in the XML config file.

- Applications now use an updated IPAddressResolver which can return IPv6
  addresses as well. This mostly eliminates the need for putting explicit
  IPv6 addresses into omnetpp.ini files e.g. as dest address for ping.
  It understands syntaxes like "server", "server[2]", "server1(ipv6)",
  "server1/eth0(ipv6)" and "server1/eth0", and retrieves the given address
  from the interface table of the given host or router module.

- PingApp and VideoStreamSvr/VideoStreamCli revised.

- Fixes in TCP. Introduced TCP algorithm classes TCPReno, TCPTaho,
  TCPNoCongestionControl, TCPDummy. Added recording of windows, sequence
  numbers etc. into output vectors.

- Unfortunately, IPv4 and IPv6 modules don't share L2 models yet: IPv4 only
  works with PPPInterface and Ethernet, and IPv6 with PPPInterface6, Ethernet6
  and Wireless. Work is underway to unify the APIs of IPv4 and IPv6 modules
  between L2 and L3.
